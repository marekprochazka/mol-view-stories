## Overview

This page will provide clear definitions of key terms and concepts used in MolViewStories.

## Planned Content

### Core Concepts

**Story**
- Definition: A complete narrative sequence of molecular visualizations
- Contains: Multiple scenes, metadata, global settings
- Format: Stored as JSON, MVStory, or other formats
- Usage: The top-level container for your molecular narrative

**Scene**
- Definition: A single view or step in your story
- Contains: MolViewSpec code, description, camera position, settings
- Purpose: Individual "slides" in your molecular presentation
- Navigation: Users progress through scenes sequentially

**Session**
- Definition: A private, saved version of your work
- Storage: Saved to your personal cloud storage
- Visibility: Only accessible to you
- Purpose: Work in progress, drafts, personal archives

**Published Story / State**
- Definition: A publicly shared version of your story
- Storage: Saved to public cloud storage
- Visibility: Accessible via shareable link
- Purpose: Final, polished content for sharing

**Asset**
- Definition: Local file uploaded to your story
- Types: PDB, CIF, MOL, SDF, or other molecular structure files
- Storage: Included within your session/story
- Usage: Referenced in scenes without external URLs

### File Formats

**MVStory (.mvstory)**
- Definition: Compressed binary session format
- Contents: Complete story with all scenes and assets
- Purpose: Efficient storage and transmission
- Usage: Save/load sessions, CLI builds

**MVSJ (.mvsj)**
- Definition: JSON state format for published stories
- Contents: Story data in human-readable format
- Purpose: Lightweight published stories
- Usage: Public story sharing

**MVSX (.mvsx)**
- Definition: Mol* viewer format (ZIP archive)
- Contents: MolViewSpec state for Mol* viewer
- Purpose: Compatibility with Mol* viewer
- Usage: Opening stories in standard Mol* viewer

**JSON**
- Definition: Human-readable story format
- Contents: Uncompressed story structure
- Purpose: Debugging, editing, integration
- Usage: Development, API integration

**HTML**
- Definition: Standalone web page
- Contents: Self-contained viewer with embedded story
- Purpose: Offline viewing, presentations
- Usage: Email attachments, conference presentations

### MolViewSpec Terms

**MolViewSpec (MVS)**
- Definition: Specification for declarative molecular visualization
- Purpose: Standardized format for molecular scenes
- Implementation: Used by Mol* and MolViewStories
- Documentation: https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec

**Builder**
- Definition: JavaScript API for creating MolViewSpec states
- Usage: `builder.download().parse().modelStructure()`
- Purpose: Programmatic scene creation
- Pattern: Method chaining / fluent interface

**Component**
- Definition: Selected portion of a molecular structure
- Examples: Chain A, residues 1-50, ligands, water
- Creation: `structure.component({ selector: ... })`
- Purpose: Isolating parts for specific representations

**Representation**
- Definition: Visual style for displaying molecules
- Types: Cartoon, ball-and-stick, surface, spacefill
- Creation: `.representation({ type: 'cartoon' })`
- Purpose: Controlling how molecules appear

**Selector**
- Definition: Query for selecting molecular components
- Syntax: `{ label_asym_id: 'A', label_seq_id: 100 }`
- Built-in: `protein`, `nucleic`, `ligand`, `water`
- Purpose: Specifying which atoms/residues to select

**Node / State Tree**
- Definition: Hierarchical structure of MVS state
- Structure: Download → Parse → Structure → Component → Representation
- Purpose: Organizing visualization instructions
- Usage: Implicit in builder method chaining

### Molecular Biology Terms

**PDB (Protein Data Bank)**
- Definition: Repository of 3D molecular structures
- URL: https://www.rcsb.org or https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe
- Format: PDB and mmCIF file formats
- Usage: Primary source for structures

**PDB ID**
- Definition: 4-character identifier for PDB entries
- Examples: 1CBS, 4HHB, 1TQN
- Usage: Loading structures from PDB

**Chain / Asymmetric ID**
- Definition: Identifier for polymer chains in structure
- Examples: A, B, C, AA, AB
- Usage: Selecting specific chains

**Residue**
- Definition: Individual amino acid or nucleotide
- Numbering: Sequential position in chain
- Selection: By number (label_seq_id) or name (label_comp_id)

**Ligand**
- Definition: Small molecule bound to protein
- Examples: ATP, drugs, cofactors
- Selection: `selector: 'ligand'`

**Assembly / Biological Assembly**
- Definition: Biologically relevant form of structure
- Context: May include multiple copies via symmetry
- Usage: `modelStructure({ assembly_id: '1' })`

### Technical Terms

**Camera**
- Definition: Virtual viewpoint for 3D scene
- Parameters: Position, target, up vector, FOV
- Purpose: Controlling what users see
- Snapshot: Saved camera state for scene

**Focus**
- Definition: Automatically center camera on component
- Usage: `.focus()`
- Purpose: Directing viewer attention

**Transformation**
- Definition: Coordinate system change (rotation/translation)
- Usage: Structural superposition
- Format: Rotation matrix + translation vector

**Isosurface**
- Definition: 3D surface at constant density value
- Usage: Electron density visualization
- Parameter: Isovalue or sigma level

**Viewport**
- Definition: 3D viewing area in the interface
- Purpose: Where molecular structures are rendered
- Interaction: Mouse rotation, zoom, pan

### Cloud & API Terms

**OIDC (OpenID Connect)**
- Definition: Authentication protocol
- Purpose: Secure login with institutional credentials
- Usage: First-time login, accessing saved work

**Quota**
- Definition: Storage limits per user
- Limits: 100 sessions, 100 published stories
- Size: 50MB per session
