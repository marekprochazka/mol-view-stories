# Welcome to MolViewStories

![](img/mol-view-stories-banner.png)

MolViewStories is a powerful web application that lets you create beautiful, interactive molecular visualizations. Whether you're a researcher, educator, or student, MolViewStories helps you tell compelling scientific stories using 3D molecular structures.

MolViewStories combines the advanced 3D rendering capabilities of [Mol*](https://molstar.org/) with a story-building interface for the [MolViewSpec](https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec) standard. It allows you to:

- **Create interactive molecular scenes** with proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules
- **Build narrative sequences** that guide viewers through complex molecular processes
- **Add custom annotations** like labels, highlights, and descriptions
- **Share your stories** with colleagues, students, or the broader scientific community
- **Export and reuse** your visualizations across different platforms

## Quick Start

## Key Features

### 🎨 Code-driven Scene Builder
Create molecular scenes with a built-in JavaScript code editor to control molecular representations, animations, and interactions. Get full access to [MolViewSpec](https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec) powerful API for advanced customizations.

### 📚 Interactive Storytelling
Combine multiple scenes into cohesive stories with descriptions, annotations, and smooth transitions between different molecular views.

### 🔗 Share Molecular Stories
Publish your stories for sharing or embedding in presentations and websites.

### ☁️ Cloud Storage
Save your work in the cloud, access it from anywhere, and collaborate with others by sharing story links.

## How It Works

1. **Load molecular structures** from online databases or upload your own files
2. **Create scenes** by positioning the camera, focusing regions of interest, and choosing visual representations
3. **Add annotations** like labels, highlights, and descriptive text
4. **Build your story** by combining scenes in a logical sequence
5. **Share or export** your completed story for others to explore
